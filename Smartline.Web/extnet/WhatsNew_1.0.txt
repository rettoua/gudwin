- XRender: Creating controls during DirectEvent/DirectMethod
	- creating controls during DirectEvent
        // automatic mode rendering   
		Panel panel1 = new Panel();
		this.Form.Controls.Add(panel);
		panel1.Render(); 
   
		//RenderTo mode
		//render to the form1 element
		// adding to the existing server side control is not required

		Panel panel1 = new Panel();
		panel1.Render(RenderMode.RenderTo, "form1"); 
   
		// AddTo mode
		// Add to the Items collection of the control
		//adding to the existing server side control is not required
		// PanelWithAccordion can be dynamic control as well and not presented in the current request

        Panel panel1 = new Panel();
		this.Form.Controls.Add(panel);
		panel1.Render(RenderMode.AddTo, "PanelWithAccordion"); 
   
	-  You can create controls outside Page. For example, in the WebService or Http Handler

       [WebMethod]
        public DirectResponse BuildWindow()
        {
            Window win = new Window
            {
                ID = "WebWindow1",
                Title = "Window from WebService",
                Height = 185,
                Width = 350,
                Html = "Hello World from WebService"
            };

            win.ContentControls.Add(new LiteralControl("testing!"));
            
            return new DirectResponse(win.ToScript());
        }
   
	- Ext.Net control can create ASP.NET controls. In this case ASP.NET will be rendered also. For example, you can create Ext.NET panel with user control
   
       protected void Button1_Click(object sender, DirectEventArgs e)
       {
        var win = new Window { 
            Title = "Customer : " + DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString(),
            Height = 185,
            Width = 350,
            Padding = 5
        };
        
        win.ContentControls.Add(this.LoadControl("MyUserControl.ascx"));

        win.Render(this.Form);
      }
    
	- Ext.Net Panel (Window and etc) can works as UpdatePanel. Just call UpdatedContent
	  Panel1.UpdateContent();
    
	- Any Ext.Net control can be updated
      Window1.Update();
